# You can even add MORE HUNDREDS of placeholders by downloading MVDW PlaceholderAPI below

# You can the placeholders for MVDW PlaceholderAPI below

# To use these extra variables in this plugin, a variable should follow this format:
# %mvdw_<placeholder without brackets>%
# For example, for players online (in MVDW this is {onlineplayers}),
# in InfoBoard, we use: %mvdw_onlineplayers% (A.K.A. the variable, without the curly braces)

#         Thank you for choosing InfoBoard
